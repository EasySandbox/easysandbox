# EasySandbox

EasySandbox is a Linux tool for managing sandboxes for linux programs.

Most functionality is implemented in libraries that implement sandboxing,
with such that wrap existing software useful for linux sandboxing such
as qemu (via libvirt), bubblewrap, or others.

This program merely directs the plugins according to user intent.
